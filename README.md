this is the website for hosting my fragments of heraclitus zine. it's on the website but i might as well include the text here. the zine itself is accessible in the root as Fragments_Of_Heraclitus.pdf

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. With a double-sided printer, print out the sheet, setting it to flip on the long side.
2. Cut along dotted gray lines to get 8 pairs of double-sided pages.
3. Stack in whatever order you like (there are 646400 possible orders, so yours will be unique), as long as the cover pages are on top. Make sure the pages don't get flipped!
4. Staple twice, along the gray line between the front and back cover, once near the bottom and once near the top.
5. Fold it closed, trim to taste, and you're all done! Remember to underline and dog-ear your favorite fragments :)

ALTERNATE TECHNIQUES:

- If you dont have a double-sided printer for step 1, you can print the first page, put it back in, and print again (usually it prints on the backside, but your printer tray should have a little icon to tell you)
- If you dont have cutting technology for step 2: fold in half twice, both horizontally and vertically. Double fold along dotted lines to weaken the paper and carefully tear.
- If you don't have a stapler for step 4, but do have some string and a sharp tool: Poke a hole in the middle, pass the string through, loop it around the back and pass it through again, loop it around the back the other way, and tie a knot!

ABOUT

Heraclitus was a pre-socratic greek philosopher of the 6th century BC. His work survives only in a little over 100 "fragments", quotations of him by other writers whose full work survives. It's not clear which of these fragments are exact quotations, which are paraphrases, and which are fabricated entirely. These glimpses into his thought suggest a thinker interested in change, sleep, death, fire, water, temperance and time. The total fragments are short enough to fit in a little booklet, which i wanted to own to carry around, so i made one! Please print out and make your own, or if you know me personally, i probably have extras to give you. i can't read ancient greek, so the translations used are cobbled together from a handful of sources i found online, edited for my personal tastes. Numbering is based on Chapter 3 of Early Greek Philosophy by John Burnet.
